I had to wait on the curb for 45 minutes while the app repeatedly lied, saying he was '2 minutes away'.\r\nWhen the cab finally arrived, the situation went from bad to worse. The driver was acting extremely strange\u2014he was slurred in his speech, couldn't follow basic GPS directions, and the car smelled strongly of alcohol. He was driving recklessly, swerving between lanes, and at one point almost hit a curb. I felt so unsafe that I had to ask him to pull over halfway through the trip and cancel the ride myself.\r\nTo top it off, I was still charged a cancellation fee even though the driver was clearly unfit to drive. This service is unreliable and dangerous. Avoid at all costs!\"",

It has now been 7 days, and I still haven\u2019t received my package.\r\nWhile the app shows the item is 'shipped,' the tracking hasn't updated in four days. To make matters worse, the contact numbers provided for the delivery service are either non-existent or perpetually unreachable. I\u2019ve reached out to customer support multiple times; they keep telling me 'not to worry' and that they are 'checking on it,' but no actual action has been taken.\r\nI understand that the e-commerce store itself doesn't personally deliver the items, but they are responsible for the logistics partners they choose. As a premium member, I expect better accountability. The product may be good, but the experience has been incredibly frustrating.",
