I had to wait on the curb for 45 minutes while the app repeatedly lied, saying he was '2 minutes away'.\r\nWhen the cab finally arrived, the situation went from bad to worse. The driver was acting extremely strange\u2014he was slurred in his speech, couldn't follow basic GPS directions, and the car smelled strongly of alcohol. He was driving recklessly, swerving between lanes, and at one point almost hit a curb. I felt so unsafe that I had to ask him to pull over halfway through the trip and cancel the ride myself.\r\nTo top it off, I was still charged a cancellation fee even though the driver was clearly unfit to drive. This service is unreliable and dangerous. Avoid at all costs!\"",

I\u2019ve reached out to customer support multiple times; they keep telling me 'not to worry' and that they are 'checking on it,' but no actual action has been taken.\r\nI understand that the e-commerce store itself doesn't personally deliver the items, but they are responsible for the logistics partners they choose.

Unlike most crowded malls, the cleaning staff here is extremely proactive, ensuring tables are cleared and sanitized almost immediately.\r\nThe freshness of the food was the highlight\u2014you can tell the ingredients haven't been sitting under heat lamps all day. I ordered from two different stalls, and both served steaming hot, high-quality meals. The service was incredibly fast; despite the lunch rush, I had my food in less than 8 minutes.\r\nThe only reason I\u2019m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the digital payment system was a bit glitchy, and I wish there were a few more healthy/vegan options available. Overall, a great spot for a quick, clean, and reliable meal!",
