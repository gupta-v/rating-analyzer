0,We got here around midnight last Friday....,4,5,"Excellent service, quality food, and great cocktails were noted. The venue offers strong features like a great patio and is highly recommended for happy hour, indicating a top-tier experience.","The tone is overwhelmingly positive, praising the quality of food ('well made pub grub'), drinks ('quality cocktails'), and service ('friendly'). The only minor negative observation (being 'dead' late at night) is contextualized and accepted by the reviewer. The update adds significant praise for the patio and happy hour potential. All core elements of the experience were excellent.",Chain-of-Thought

2,"Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We ...",3,4,"Reviewer is a loyal, weekly customer.
Food is described as 'good and filling' and satisfying.
Experience is reliable and meets expectations.","The tone is overwhelmingly positive, indicating high customer loyalty (eats there every Friday). Specific items (pizza wraps, iced tea) are praised as 'good and filling' and satisfying ('hits the spot'). The only neutral comment is 'Typical strip mall pizza,' which suggests standard quality but does not detract from the weekly enjoyment. The high frequency of visits and specific positive feedback warrant a strong 4-star rating.",Chain-of-Thought
3,"My husband and I were really, really dis...",1,1,"The dealership grossly misdiagnosed a simple $100 cleaning issue as a $3000+ repair, suggesting dishonesty and an attempt to defraud the customer. This resulted in a complete loss of trust and future business.","The tone is highly negative, starting with 'really, really disappointed.' The primary complaint is a severe misdiagnosis: Coulter quoted over $3000 for a full moon roof track replacement, while a second opinion revealed the issue was merely dirt and debris requiring a $100 cleaning. The customer believes the dealership intentionally lied. There are zero praises. The cons (alleged dishonesty, massive overcharge attempt, poor corporate support) heavily outweigh the pros. This level of alleged fraud warrants the lowest possible rating.",Chain-of-Thought

The reviewer strongly recommends the hotel, noting the pros heavily outweigh the single minor noise complaint.","The tone is highly positive, emphasizing excellent value (lower price, free parking) and good amenities (clean, large rooms, decent breakfast). The reviewer dismisses common complaints (noise, safety) and only notes one minor annoyance (hearing neighbors in the bathroom). The reviewer concludes the hotel is a 'great choice' and would stay again, indicating a top-tier experience relative to expectations and price point.",Chain-of-Thought
6,I love that this place has top seafood p...,4,5,"The review praises top food quality, excellent value, and the major convenience of late-night service (till 2 AM). The single service flaw was quickly corrected, justifying a top rating.","The tone is overwhelmingly positive, highlighted by phrases like 'I love,' 'top seafood,' and 'The best part.' The only complaint is that service is 'hit and miss,' but this is immediately mitigated by an example of excellent service recovery. Praises focus on high food quality (salmon, eels, octopus), great value (inexpensive drinks, good happy hour), and a major convenience factor (food served until 2 AM). The numerous, specific, and strong pros heavily outweigh the single, mitigated con.",Chain-of-Thought

Specific praises include suitability for work, excellent food quality, generous portions, and good indoor/outdoor seating options. 3. There are zero complaints; the mention of 'Always busy' is framed as a sign of popularity rather than a negative. 4. The strong positive language and lack of drawbacks mandate the highest possible rating.",Chain-of-Thought
9,"1 star for service, but the food is not ...",1,1,"The review details repeated, critical failures in food portioning (little to no meat) across multiple visits. Service was also rated poorly (1 star). The customer explicitly states they will not return.","1. Tone: Negative. 2. Complaints: The primary complaint is the extremely poor portion size ('4 pieces of chicken,' 'little to no meat') which occurred on two separate visits for different items. The reviewer also explicitly rates the service as 1 star. 3. Weighing: There are no pros; the review details fundamental failures in both product (food) and service, resulting in the customer stating they will not return. 4. Rating: 1 star.",Chain-of-Thought
